      <h2>Professional Bio</h2>
      <p>I'm Rowan, a mathematician and educator based in the San Francisco Bay Area. My areas of special interest are Number Theory and Algebra. I’ve spent most of my adult life teaching mathematics and helping others see the beauty in abstraction, structure, and proof.</p>

      <h2>Tutoring</h2>
      <p>I offer one-on-one tutoring sessions for students at all levels — from high school to graduate school — tailored to your goals and preferred learning format. Sessions are available privately or livestreamed depending on your comfort and budget.</p>

      <h2>Streaming</h2>
      <p>I stream live lessons that explore math from multiple angles — sometimes structured, sometimes exploratory. The goal is always to help people engage with math as a creative, logical process, not just a set of rules to memorize.</p>

      <h2>Video Recording</h2>
      <p>Each episode of From Zero to Zeta is written, recorded, and edited with care — to bring depth and clarity to abstract topics. I focus on guiding the viewer from intuition to formalism, all while keeping the tone approachable and focused.</p>

      <h2>Hosting Events</h2>
      <p>Beyond YouTube, I host math events and community discussions on Discord and via YouTube livestreams — from office hours and open problem sessions to topic-based presentations and philosophical math debates.</p>
